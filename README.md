## Anisotropic Fluid model

Master thesis regarding anisotropic viscoelastic fluids defended on 4.2.2020. Simple anisotropic models similar to Oldroyd-B and Giesekus are developed. Second law of thermodynamics is enforced directly and Objectivity of all resulting equations is evident. The basic properties of the models are tested using simple flows and compared to the real-world materials.

Repository contains the thesis text and the codes neeeded to run the simulations. 

In order to run the codes Fenics 2019.1.0  is required. See [Fenics](https://fenicsproject.org/). To visualise the results Paraview can be used.
